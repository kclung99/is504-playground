They've figured out the perfect scam - make customers do employee work for free while calling it 'innovation.' Gas pumps, online banking, travel booking, grocery scanning, airport check-ins. Every single thing that used to be a paid job, they've shifted to us. They call it 'convenience' but it's really just cost-shifting to maximize profits while cutting labor costs. The genius part is they've somehow convinced us to be grateful for doing their work.
